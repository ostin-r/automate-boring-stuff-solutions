My solutions to problems posed in "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python"

After a bunch of self directed projects, I think it is about time that I started following a book on the important components of coding in python.  This was prompted by my overzealous attempt to take on multiple projects that were too big for me to handle.  This file will be used as a short description of each project, bonus features that I may have added, and notes about what I learned from each project.

Chapter 3:

- Project 1: [collatz.py](https://github.com/ostin-r/automate-boring-stuff-solutions/blob/main/Chapter%203/collatz.py)  Used the collatz sequence to make a function that takes any positive integer as an argument and prints the collatz sequence (which always converges to 1, eventually).  My first time learning about and using 'try' and 'except' statements, whcih I have always seen but never implemented.  Bonus feature:  I made it so the user can continue to test sequence with different integers and quit the program by typing in 'q' and pressing enter.
