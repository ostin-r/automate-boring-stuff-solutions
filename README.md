My solutions to problems posed in "Automate The Boring Stuff with Python"

After a bunch of self directed projects, I think it is about time that I started following a book on the important components of coding in python.  This was prompted by my overzealous attempt to take on multiple projects that were too big for me to handle.  While I probably have a decent understanding of chapters 0-3, I am still going to attempt the practice problems without reading the chapter as a check to see if I understand the chapter.
